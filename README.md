# SupaViber

> Your personal vibe coding toolkit - custom skills, agents, and commands for an optimized development environment

SupaViber is a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin that helps you manage and share your custom development workflows, automation, and AI-powered tools. Build your ideal coding environment with reusable components.

## What is SupaViber?

SupaViber provides a structured way to organize and share:

- **Skills** - AI workflows that Claude automatically uses based on context
- **Agents** - Specialized subagents for specific tasks
- **Commands** - User-invoked slash commands for common operations
- **Hooks** - Event-driven automation that runs automatically

Whether you're setting up a new machine or sharing your workflows with a team, SupaViber makes it easy to package and deploy your development environment.

## Included Skills

SupaViber comes with built-in skills ready to use:

### Git Safety
**`git-safety`** - Comprehensive git safety protocols for collaborative environments

- 🛡️ Prevents destructive operations (hard resets, force pushes) without explicit approval
- 🚫 Protects environment files (.env) from accidental modification
- ⚠️ Enforces safe commit practices with verification checklists
- 🤝 Coordinates file deletions and changes in team environments
- ✅ Ensures explicit file paths and atomic commits

Claude automatically applies these safety protocols when working with git commands and file operations.

### Coding Standards
**`coding-standards`** - Guide for writing clean, maintainable code following industry best practices

- 🎯 Applies SOLID principles and design patterns (DRY, composition over inheritance)
- 📏 Enforces single responsibility and clear function boundaries
- 🏗️ Promotes testable, extensible code architecture
- 📝 Ensures meaningful naming conventions and documentation
- ✨ Includes self-review checklist and refactoring guidance
- 🌐 Language-specific best practices for Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust

Claude uses this skill when writing or reviewing code to ensure consistency, readability, and long-term maintainability.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Your First Skill

Create a new skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/my-workflow
```

Create `skills/my-workflow/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-workflow
description: Describe when Claude should use this skill
---

Your skill instructions here...
```

### 2. Create a Slash Command

Add a command file to `commands/`:

```bash
echo "---
description: Example command
---

Do something useful!" > commands/example.md
```

Use it with: `/supaviber:example`

### 3. Define a Custom Agent

Create `agents/my-agent.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Specialized agent for X
capabilities: ["capability1", "capability2"]
---

# My Agent

This agent specializes in...
```

## Components

### Skills (`skills/`)

Agent Skills that Claude automatically invokes based on task context. Each skill is a subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file.

**Structure:**
```
skills/
└── skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md       # Required: skill definition
    └── reference.md   # Optional: additional context
```

See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Agents (`agents/`)

Custom subagents with specialized capabilities. Each agent is defined in a markdown file.

**Structure:**
```
agents/
└── agent-name.md
```

See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Commands (`commands/`)

User-invoked slash commands. Filename becomes the command name (prefixed with `supaviber:`).

**Structure:**
```
commands/
└── command-name.md    # Creates /supaviber:command-name
```

See [commands/README.md](commands/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Hooks (`hooks/`)

Event-driven automation that triggers on Claude Code events like file changes, session start, etc.

**Structure:**
```
hooks/
└── hooks.json         # Hook configuration
```

See [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Development

### Adding Components

1. **Skills**: Create a directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file
2. **Agents**: Add a `.md` file to `agents/`
3. **Commands**: Add a `.md` file to `commands/`
4. **Hooks**: Edit `hooks/hooks.json` or create individual hook files

### Testing Locally

Load the plugin in development mode:

```bash
cd supaviber
claude --plugin-dir .
```
